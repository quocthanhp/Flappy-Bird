# Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird is a game where player controls bird by pressing the space bar and attempts to fly the bird between pairs of pipes. In this new version, bird
is able to collect weapons along the way and press S to destroy the pipes in level 2 of the game. Each type of weapon has the shooting range and type of 
pipes it can destroy.

| Weapon        | Shooting range | Target Types  |
| ------------- |:-------------- | :------------ |
| Rock          | 25 pixels      | Plastic Pipes |
| Boom          | 50 pixels      | All Pipes     |

The game has 2 levels: <br />
Level 1: Bird has 3 lives. Win by scoring 10 (earn score by successfully crossing the pairs of pipes). <br />
Level 2: Bird has 6 lives. Win by scoring 30 (earn score by successfully crossing the pairs of pipes or destroying pipes). <br />
For both levels, player loses when all lives of bird is depleted. One life is depleted when bird collapses with pipes or flies out of screen.
